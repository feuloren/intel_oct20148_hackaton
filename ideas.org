* Room manager
  Use temperature, light and sound sensors to monitor the room.
  We can try to turn a light switch with the servo
  And switch an appliance on/off with the relay

** Selling points
   Use board full power to run a web server directly on it
   Send sms (with twillio) or mails

** Potential difficulties
   May be disconnected from wifi temporarily, we should handle it nicely
   
** Actual difficulties
   > represents shell on my machine
   $ represents root shell on edison
   >>> represents python shell on edison

   > screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
   login: root
   $ configure_edison --wifi
   Realy easy to use, connect to your network and save the IP address somewhere

   Half-assed python install on the board,
   Had to install pip with get-pip (find the link again)
   Then there was a lot of missing files I had to copy from my own system
   > scp /usr/lib/python2.7/numbers.py root@10.10.25.90:/usr/lib/python2.7/
   > scp -r /usr/lib/python2.7/unittest/ root@10.10.25.90:/usr/lib/python2.7/
   > scp /usr/lib/python2.7/difflib.py root@10.10.25.90:/usr/lib/python2.7/
   

   Then I has to install mraa and upm
   from their github ( https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa )
   $ echo "src mraa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/1.1/intelgalactic" > /etc/opkg/mraa-upm.conf
   $ opkg update
   $ opkg install libmraa0
   $ opkg install upm
